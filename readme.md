Title: Team Profile Generator

Description: Using node.js the application will allow the user to input data about staff.

Depending on the staff type added, different inputs will be presented.

The inputs will be saved and displayed on HTML.   

INCOMPLETE PROJECT:
Have been able to get all the node JS functions to work and capture the answers. But can't get the information to render to HTML.
